Hello There!

This is my Portfolio for "09571 Social Media - Einf√ºhrung in das Gestalten von Online-Medien WiSe 2324".

the Website starts by showing you my Homescreen. You can go to different web pages from here. You can have a look at my CV and the different exercised we did in class.

I have used pictures from the internet and their url as well as some Pictures i have saved on my computer. Please mind, that the Origin Path will differ:
e.g. "C:\Users\huttn\Documents\Studium\1. Semester WS 23-24\Social Media\Portfolio\Portfolio_Anna-Huttner_WISE 23-24_ Social-Media\http.jpg" will be different for your Computer.

I also added the PP Presentations in two different formats (PP & PDF), if someone wants to have a closer look.

Have fun browsing!


Your Host,
Anna Huttner
